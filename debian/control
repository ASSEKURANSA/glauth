 Go-lang LDAP Authentication (GLAuth) is a secure, easy-to-use, LDAP server
 with configurable backends.
 .
 Use it to centralize account management across your Linux servers, your
 OSX machines, and your support applications.
 .
 Features:
 .
  * Centrally manage SSH keys, Linux accounts, and passwords for cloud
    servers.
  * Lightweight alternative to OpenLDAP and Active Directory for
    development, or a homelab.
  * Store your user directory in a file, local or in S3; SQL database; or
    proxy to existing LDAP servers.
  * Two Factor Authentication (transparent to applications).
  * Multiple backends can be chained to inject features.
